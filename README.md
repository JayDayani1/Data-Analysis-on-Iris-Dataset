# Data-Analysis-on-Iris-Dataset
The project involves comprehensive data analysis and machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building and evaluating predictive models. The primary goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data and make accurate predictions using various machine learning algorithms.

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or outliers.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. This includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the models, and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.
4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Comparing the performance of different models and selecting the best one based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
